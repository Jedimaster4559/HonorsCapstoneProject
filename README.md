# Honors Capstone Project
A Musescore plugin that can assess partwriting and find any errors that may have been made.

# Installation
To install this plugin, copy the `errorIdentifier.qml` file into Musescore's Plugins directory. This is often placed in one of a couple locations. See the following page for more details on installation [https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation)

# Running
To run the plugin, open musescore and  then select the plugins manager from the plugins menu. If the plugin was installed correctly (see [installation](#installation)) you should see this plugin identified in that list. Selecting the checkbox by the plugin will make the plugin available for use.

Once these steps have been completed, the plugin can be run at any time by selecting it from the analysis section of the plugins menu.

# Credits
There are a couple people I would like to thank for their assistance on this project.

Dr. Vineetha Menon served as my capstone director. Her assistance greatly helped keep the project on schedule and on track for success.

The [Chord Identifier Plugin](https://github.com/animikatamon/MuseScorePlugins) by @animikatamon was really helpful for getting off the ground with this project and getting an understanding of implementing MuseScore Plugins with QML.
