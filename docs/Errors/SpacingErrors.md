# Spacing Errors
Spacing Errors occur when two parts are spread too far apart.

For Example, in the image above, the spacing between the soprano and the alto is greater than an octav, thus a spacing error has occurred

# Default Configuration
TODO: Insert images of these spacings
- Soprano - Alto: Perfect Octave
- Alto - Tenor: Perfect Octave
- Tenor - Bass: Perfect 15va (2 Octaves)
