# Melodic Dissonance Errors
Melodic Dissonances occur when an augmented or diminished interval occurs melodically within a single part.

TODO: Insert image demo of this

Melodic Dissonances most frequently occur in minor between the 6th and 7th scale degrees. When using a harmonic minor scale, the interval here is an augmented second. It can be easy to overlook this one as it doesn't stand out as much as some other errors do. While this is the most common occurance of this error, it should is not the only occuring one.

This ended up being a pretty neat check to implement. See Interesting Notes (TODO: Insert link) for more details.
